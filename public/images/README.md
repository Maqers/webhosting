# Product Images

Place your product images in this folder.

## Naming Convention

Name your images as: `product{id}-{imageNumber}.jpg`

### Examples:
- `product1-1.jpg` - First image of product with ID 1
- `product1-2.jpg` - Second image of product with ID 1
- `product1-3.jpg` - Third image of product with ID 1
- `product2-1.jpg` - First image of product with ID 2
- And so on...

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended Size**: 800x800px to 1200x1200px (square images work best)
- **File Size**: Optimize images to keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quantity**: Each product needs exactly 3 images

## Tips for Fast Loading

1. **Optimize Images**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim before uploading
2. **Use WebP Format**: Modern browsers support WebP which offers better compression
3. **Consistent Dimensions**: Keep all product images the same size for a uniform look
4. **Lazy Loading**: Images are automatically lazy-loaded, so don't worry about too many images
